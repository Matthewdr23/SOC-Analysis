# Introduction of SIEM Alerts
The thing about SIEM alerts in the field is that the more time you spend on an alert the less time youb have in the day for the other 100s of alerts waiting to be reviewed. 

You need to be able to carefully look through each alert with detail and confidence so that no mistakes are made but also flash like efficency so that your back log does not become overloaded. 

The more alerts you tackle and close, the faster you can respond to new attacks and handle the 100s of alerts thaty come through any SOC.
